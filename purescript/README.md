# purescript

It was hard to understand where to start. The documentation is not friendly to newcomers to the language, and I get the feeling they already expect you to understand Haskell.

I ended up using Spago as my build tool and package manager, but I also came across examples and documentation that use bower and esbuild or webpack.

I ended up having to copy and past some examples to get my app started, and I relied on VSCode's Purescipt IDE plugin to help me generate types for my components. It's not an easy type system to get into, and while I was able to get VSCode to show me more details about the types I found the details to be cryptic.

I can't recommend PureScript as a language for JS devs to switch over to, but I can see the value in using something like this for some data heavy websites where types and a strong compiler matter. It would probably take me a few months to really dig into the docs and understand the language better. I can also see the appeal for developers coming from Haskell into a language that is focused on front-end development.
